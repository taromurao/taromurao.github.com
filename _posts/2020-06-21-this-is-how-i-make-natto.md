title:  "This is how I make natto"

The soya beans must be soaked for a night. I usually cook the soaked soy beans in the morning, around 8 or 9 o'clock, with a pressure cooker because it shortens cooking time substaintially. I also try to use organic soy beans.

When beans are cooked, I immediately mix a small amount of dry natto. Some say that one could make natto with a bit of joghurt, but I have not tried it yet. Some boiled water could be poured into Whatever containers to be used for the fermentation process, just to make sure that other bacterias would not dominate the fermentation process.

Then I leave the soy beans in (and on) a joghurt maker till evening (around 6 o'clock). A couple of things I take attention are

1. Place soy beans in such a way that no more than 3 or 4 of beans stack up on each other (It looks that they need enough oxygen).
2. On contrally they look like they do not want to be dry.
3. They look to have an optimum temperature of around 40 degrees.
4. They seem to dislike light.

To satisfy 2. and 4. I place containers closed, but slightly leave the lids open. To full fill 4., I place a big metal bowl on top. As a side-effect, the bowl contributes to sustain the temparature around ideal.

The natto can be consumed soon. The rest can be stored in a fridge for a week long.
